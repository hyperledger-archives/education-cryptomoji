   * The apply method is where the vast majority of all the work of a
   * transaction processor happens. It will be called once for every
   * transaction, passing two objects: a transaction process request ("txn" for
   * short) and state context.
   *
   * Properties of `txn`:
   *   - txn.payload: the encoded payload sent from your client
   *   - txn.header: the decoded TransactionHeader for this transaction
   *   - txn.signature: the hex signature of the header
   *
   * Methods of `context`:
   *   - context.getState(addresses): takes an array of addresses and returns
   *     a Promise which will resolve with the requested state. The state
   *     object will have keys which are addresses, and values that are encoded
   *     state resources.
   *   - context.setState(updates): takes an update object and returns a
   *     Promise which will resolve with an array of the successfully
   *     updated addresses. The updates object should have keys which are
   *     addresses, and values which are encoded state resources.
   *   - context.deleteState(addresses): deletes the state for the passed
   *     array of state addresses. Only needed if attempting the extra credit.
